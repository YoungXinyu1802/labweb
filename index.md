# **SunLab @ Cornell**

We build intelligent systems that collaborate with scientists to accelerate discovery. By developing novel machine learning and computer vision algorithms, we enable researchers to extract deeper insights from complex datasets, pushing beyond the boundaries of traditional analysis. We are particularly interested in:

*   How can we enable new capabilities that allow human experts and AI systems to effectively collaborate in scientific discovery?
*   How can we incorporate domain-specific knowledge into machine learning models to improve their effectiveness in scientific applications?
*   How can we ensure that AI-generated insights are transparent and understandable to human experts?
*   Scaling existing algorithms and systems that are capable of processing and interpreting the ever-increasing volume of data in fields like behavior analysis and biology

If your research involves messy, large-scale experimental data, the need for interpretable insights, or exploring new ways to integrate AI into your scientific workflows, we invite you to collaborate. Let's work together to push the boundaries of knowledge!
